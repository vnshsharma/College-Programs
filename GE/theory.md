## ðŸ“š About GE Subject  

- **Generic Elective (GE)** is an optional subject chosen outside the main discipline.
- It helps students learn new topics and enhance practical problem-solving skills.
- In science streams, GE often includes basic computational methods and applied mathematics.

---

## ðŸ“Š Numerical Methods (Covered in This Repo)

Numerical Methods are techniques used to find approximate solutions to mathematical problems that cannot be solved easily by standard analytical methods.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Bisection Method  
- Used to find the root (zero) of a continuous function.
- Works by dividing an interval in half repeatedly.
- Chooses the sub-interval where the sign of the function changes.
- Simple, slow but reliable method.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Secant Method  
- Also used to find the root of a function.
- Uses a sequence of secant lines to estimate the root.
- Faster than the Bisection Method.
- Needs two initial guesses, doesnâ€™t require derivative.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Trapezoidal Rule  
- A method for approximating definite integrals.
- Divides the total area under a curve into trapezoids.
- Calculates the area of each trapezoid and adds them.
- Simple and improves accuracy by increasing the number of divisions.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Lagrange Interpolation  
- Used to estimate values between known data points.
- Constructs a polynomial that passes exactly through the given points.
- Helps in curve fitting and data approximation.
- Does not require equally spaced data points.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose of These Methods  

- To handle mathematical problems where direct formulas or solutions are not possible.
- To develop a computational approach to physics and engineering problems.
- Useful for practical applications in scientific and research work.

## ðŸ“‘ Note  

- These notes are prepared as a part of the **Generic Elective (GE)** course.
- Intended for academic use and personal study reference.
