#  College Programs Repository

## ✦ Introduction

This repository is a structured collection of **college-level academic programs**, written with clarity, logic, and conceptual depth.  
It reflects the intersection of **theoretical understanding** and **practical implementation**, as demanded in a modern science curriculum.

The content is organized across three core academic domains:

###  Quantum Mechanics  
Programs focused on the mathematical and computational foundations of quantum theory — from wavefunctions and operators to numerical methods used in solving quantum systems.  
Emphasis is placed on **conceptual correctness**, **physical interpretation**, and **clean implementation**.

###  Generic Elective  
A diverse set of programs drawn from interdisciplinary subjects, designed to strengthen analytical thinking, communication, and applied problem-solving skills beyond the core syllabus.

###  Data Structures & Algorithms  
Algorithmic implementations of fundamental data structures and problem-solving techniques, written with attention to **efficiency**, **readability**, and **real-world relevance**.  
The goal is not just to make code work — but to make it *make sense*.
