## ðŸ“– Generic Elective (GE)

This section includes implementations of numerical techniques typically taught in the **Generic Elective (GE)** courses for undergraduate students.

### ðŸ”¹ Bisection Method
A root-finding technique that works by repeatedly dividing an interval in half and selecting the subinterval in which the function changes sign, thereby narrowing the possible location of the root.

**Application:**  
Solving algebraic and transcendental equations where analytical methods are tough.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Trapezoidal Rule
A numerical integration method that approximates the area under a curve by dividing it into trapezoids and summing their areas.

**Application:**  
Estimating definite integrals, especially when an explicit antiderivative is hard to obtain.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Secant Method
An iterative numerical technique to approximate the root of a function. It uses two initial approximations and a secant line through those points to estimate the root.

**Application:**  
Finding approximate solutions to equations without needing derivatives.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Lagrange Interpolation
A polynomial interpolation method used to estimate the value of a function at a given point using known data points.

**Application:**  
Interpolating values within a range of known data points when the functional relationship is unknown.
