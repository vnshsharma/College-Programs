## 📖 Generic Elective (GE)

This section includes implementations and formulas for essential numerical methods typically taught in **Generic Elective (GE)** courses.

### 🔹 Bisection Method

**Description:**  
A root-finding method that repeatedly halves an interval to locate a root of a given equation.

**Formula:**

**Where:**  
- `a, b` = Initial guesses (interval)  
- `c` = Midpoint of interval  
- `f(c)` = Function value at c

### 🔹 Trapezoidal Rule

**Description:**  
A numerical integration method that approximates the area under a curve as a sum of trapezoid areas.

**Formula:**

**Where:**  
- `a, b` = Limits of integration  
- `h` = (b - a) / n (interval width)  
- `n` = Number of intervals  
- `f(x)` = Function to integrate  
- `I` = Approximate value of integral

### 🔹 Secant Method

**Description:**  
An iterative technique to approximate the root of a function using a secant line between two approximations.

**Formula:**

**Where:**  
- `xₙ, xₙ₋₁` = Previous approximations  
- `f(xₙ), f(xₙ₋₁)` = Function values at approximations  
- `xₙ₊₁` = Next approximation

### 🔹 Lagrange Interpolation

**Description:**  
A polynomial interpolation technique that estimates the value of a function based on known data points.

**Formula:**  

![Lagrange Formula](../images/Lagrange1.png)

**Where:**  
- `(x₀, y₀), (x₁, y₁), ..., (xₙ, yₙ)` = Known data points  
- `P(x)` = Interpolated value at x  
- `Lᵢ(x)` = Lagrange basis polynomial
