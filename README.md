## ðŸ“– Generic Elective (GE)

This section includes implementations and formulas for essential numerical methods typically taught in **Generic Elective (GE)** courses.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Bisection Method

**Description:**  
A root-finding method that repeatedly halves an interval to locate a root of a given equation.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Trapezoidal Rule

**Description:**  
A numerical integration method that approximates the area under a curve as a sum of trapezoid areas.


---

### ðŸ”¹ Secant Method

**Description:**  
An iterative technique to approximate the root of a function using a secant line between two approximations.
 

---

### ðŸ”¹ Lagrange Interpolation

**Description:**  
A polynomial interpolation technique that estimates the value of a function based on known data points.
